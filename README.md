ðŸŽ® **[Play Demo Here](https://zugzug90.github.io/web-mobile-gestures-starter/)**

Solution is ispired by [Dragosha solution](https://dragosha.com/defold/pinch/).

Idea is based on constant `update(dt)` loop + detecting tap points and analyzing current vs. previous tap point pairs distances/angles.

## Module's API & Use Cases
TBD

For now please look into `input_actions_controller.script` as a basic usage case.

## Project Dependencies and Prerequisits
1. Project uses [orthographic camera](https://github.com/britzl/defold-orthographic)
1. Project uses [input gesture](https://github.com/britzl/defold-input/blob/master/in/gesture.md)
1. Project uses custom `orthographic.render` and `orthographic.render_script` from orthographic camera solution

## What's implemented:
1. Handling touches/clicks
2. Zoom In / Zoom Out with the mouse scroll
3. Pinch Zoom In / Zoom Out for mobile browsers
4. Swipes to move camera around - both with the mouse drags and swipes on mobile web

Additionaly there is a borders clamping on top of the camera moves and zooms behavior to limit how far player can navigate on the game.

## Out of scope:
1. Rotations
1. Camera does not center to the exact mouse cursor position when zooming. Might be nice to have as an alternative mode in future.
1. Double taps, Long taps
